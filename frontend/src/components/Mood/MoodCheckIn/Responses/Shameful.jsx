        When we feel guilty it's usually over something we did wrong. As
        in, "I did something bad."
      </p>
      <p>
        Shame, on the other hand, is much more sinister. Shame creeps in
        when we feel we are internally bad. Not just how we've behaved. As
        in, "I am bad."

        Pull out the roots of shame to live a life full of self acceptance.
