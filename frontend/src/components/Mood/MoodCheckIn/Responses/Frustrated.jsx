        If not handled correctly, frustration can quickly turn to anger.
        Work to identify the reason for your frustration to minimize its
        impact on your mental well being.

        Learning to accept a given circumstance is a stoic principle. When
        you come up on an obstacle in your path, getting around the
        obstacle becomes your new path. It will do you well to remember
        this principle when life throws frustrations your way.
