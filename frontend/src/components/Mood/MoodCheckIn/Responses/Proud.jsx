        So you're proud. Proud of what you've accomplished or who you've
        become.
      </p>
      <p>
        Capture this feeling. Let it morph into confidence. Let it give
        birth to self respect, happiness and self-assurance. Relish in your
        achievement.

        Give gratitude to yourself and appreciate the obstacles you've
        overcome to get here.
