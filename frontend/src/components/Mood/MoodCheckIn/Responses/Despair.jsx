      <p>
        feelings of sadness are part of the human condition. and while
        you'd like to avoid moments of sadness, you've come to accept these
        moments as a part of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        however, feelings of despair are much more challenging to work
        through. getting the motivation to work through despair takes
        energy, the same energy it works to take away from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        to start working through these feelings you mut be systematic in
        your approach and fearless in facing it head on.
      </p>
      <p>
        the good news is your first step is already complete. you've
        identified the feeling. You're self aware. But often in self
        awareness you may forget you're human. And because you're human you
        shouldn't expect perfection. From yourself or anyone else.

        Please remember in these temporary moments of despair that you are
        not defined by emotions and that you are loved.
