      <p>
        Like anxiety, fear is just doing its job. It has the all important
        task of keeping you alive. For example, being afraid of a snarling
        dogs is in your best interest.

        But you can easily lose control when fear begins to perceive
        emotional insecurities as existential threats.
      </p>
      <p>
        These fears can work against you and make you feel like you can't
        succeed, or worse they can keep you from bettering yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully you can teach your fear new parameters after identifying
        the irrational thoughts holding you back
