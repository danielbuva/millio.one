      <p>
        When you feel guilty there are a couple of questions you need to
        ask yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you irrationally holding on to this feeling? Did your action or
        lack of action truly cause disruption or pain to someone? if you
        caused disruption or pain to someone? If you caused someone else
        pain, how can you make amends?
      </p>
      <p>
        Also remember, even though guilt does not bring positive emotions,
        you are human, you make mistakes and feeling guilt demonstrates you
        deep empathy for others.
      </p>
      <p>
        What happened happened, It is what it is. The past cannot be
        changed. Don't wast too muh energy Focus on how you can now
        minimize the negative effects of your actions and learn for the
        future.
      </p>
