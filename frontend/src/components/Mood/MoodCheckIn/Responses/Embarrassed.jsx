      <p>
        Everyone feels embarrassment at some point in their life. Many
        times. It's a normal state of being.
      </p>
      <p>
        You worry other people are judging you. And, unfortunately, you
        most likely judge yourself the most i embarrassing situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you can tame that inner critic you can actually learn from
        these situations. Learn to remove the stigma of embarrassment and
        accept that you aren't expected to be perfect.
