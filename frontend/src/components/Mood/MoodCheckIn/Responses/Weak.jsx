      <p>
        If you're geeling weak take a moment to identify what is causing
        this feeling. Is it something physical? Something emotional?
        Something you can change? Something you can avoid?
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you identify the source of your weakness you can prioritize
        ways to strengthen your resolve and address the issue at hand.
