        Gried is the pain you feel after a loss. We feel it not only when
        missing people and animals but also things, or activities - like
        recent lockdowns showed us.
      </p>
      <p>
        We all grieve in our own way so don't worry if your grief looks
        different than someone else's grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        And while grief may be painful, don't ignore or hide from it. As
        Seneca states, it is best to conquer grief than to attempt to
        deceive it. Take time to sit with your grief, process it and work
        on acceptance of your loss.
