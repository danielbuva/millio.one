      <p>
        Rejection comes in many forms. In friendshiops and in love. In your
        work and in your creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has a way of manifesting self doubt. It decreases confidence. It
        hinders you from trusting your instincts. And the more you're
        rejected the less risks you take in life. This limits your
        potential for being self actualized.
      </p>
      <p>But there is a way through rejection.</p>
      <p>
        Don't take rejection personally. And don't assume you know why you
        are being rejected. Often our insecurities fill in knowledge gaps
        with incorrect assumptions. These assumptions, when based in our
        own insecurities are often irrational and misleading.
