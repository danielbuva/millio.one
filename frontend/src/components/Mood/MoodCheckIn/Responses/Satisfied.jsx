        Being satisfied is being content. Content with what you have, with
        who you are, with where your life is in this moment. You've met
        your current needs.

      <p>
        Satisfaction is different for everyone. Keep living a life of
        gratitude and you will continue living in satisfaction. You're
        demonstrating self mastery in this moment.
