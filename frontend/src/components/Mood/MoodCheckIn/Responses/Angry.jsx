      <h1>let's look at your Anger.</h1>
      <p>
        with powerful self righteousness, anger leaps to action at a
        moment's notice. the rawest of emotions, anger is as harmful to you
        as it is to those around you.
      </p>
      <p>
        anger is often a secondary emotion, fueled by your insecurities and
        fears. when you learn to identify the primary emotion stoking the
        flames of anger you will reduce its power.
      </p>
      <p>
        but don't judge yourself too harshly for feeling angry. after all,
        it's a natural emotion and you've been conditioned to express it
        your entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
        having a journaling practice and becoming more mindful about your
        emotions will allow you to identify, understand and stop your anger
        from controlling you.
