      <p>
        Insecurities are shots to your ego that leave you feeling
        inadequate. If left unchecked they multiply, creating more problems
        than just feeling like you aren't good enough.

        The can come from internal or external sources. Examples include
        relationshops, finances, comparing yourself to others and, of
        course, trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately you can weed them out by identifying and challenging
        each one. Intentionally working through your insecurities is the
        only way to reduce the negative impact they have on your life.
