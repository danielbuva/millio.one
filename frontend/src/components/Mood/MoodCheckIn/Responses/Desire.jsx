      <p>
        Desiring something is not inherently bad. There are a lot of things
        to want in life; it's what makes life worth living.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's when our desires run amok and control us that it becomes an
        issure. If you don't control them they'll end up controlling you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reflecting on your desire helps make sure you're seeking only that
        which will serve you.
