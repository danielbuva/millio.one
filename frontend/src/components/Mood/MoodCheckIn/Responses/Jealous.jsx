      <p>
        Jealousy is a mean spiritied emotion. It tricks you into thinking
        you have every right to feel this way, but it's just masking your
        deepest insecurities.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you feel it come on do yourself a favor and identify what
        insecurity is causing you to feel this way.
      </p>
      <p>That's how you end jealousy</p>
