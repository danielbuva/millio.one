      <p>
        Sadness is to be expected. Life tends to happen and some of it can
        be sad. Like many emotions, sadness can be temporary
      </p>
      <p>
        Your goal with sadness is to accept the events in your life causing
        the sadness, grieve properly and respect your process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, when you are ready, move out of sadness in an effort to avoid
        a depressive state.
