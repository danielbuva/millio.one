        Sometimes you stop, look around at life passing by and think,
        "Isn't there more to life than this?"
      </p>
      <p>
        And changes are, there is much more to life - especially if you're
        feeling unfulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn't mean you have to make abrupt or severe changes.
        Sometimes it's the tweaks that make all the difference in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you do need to answer the question, "How could I feel more
        alive today?"
      </p>
      <p>And then be bold enough to follow your heart.</p>
