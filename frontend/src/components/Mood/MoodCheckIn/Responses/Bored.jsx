      <p>
        Boredom may seem like a boring subject in itself. But watch out
        because it's a passive aggressive emotion.

        You may find yourself returning to negative throughts when bored.
        Working them over and over in your mind, making them more powerful.
        You may repeat a negative, habitual behavior out of boredome. You
        may relapse. Or become agitated with those around you. It's
        important to addres your boredome before it turns into something
        more devious.
