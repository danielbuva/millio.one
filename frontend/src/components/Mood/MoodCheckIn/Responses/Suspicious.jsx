        Suspicion may arise when someone else's behavior seems odd or
        confusing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you;re correct in your suspicions before acating on them.
        It's easy to assume the worst when there may actually be a
        reasonable answer for their behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even if your suspicions are correct, react with control and
        purpose. Otherwise you're adding to the problem, not the solution.
