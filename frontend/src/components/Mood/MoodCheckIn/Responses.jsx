        with powerful self righteousness, anger leaps to action at a
        moment's notice. the rawest of emotions, anger is as harmful to you
        as it is to those around you.
      </p>
      <p>
        anger is often a secondary emotion, fueled by your insecurities and
        fears. when you learn to identify the primary emotion stoking the
        flames of anger you will reduce its power.
      </p>
      <p>
        but don't judge yourself too harshly for feeling angry. after all,
        it's a natural emotion and you've been conditioned to express it
        your entire life.
      </p>
      <p>
        having a journaling practice and becoming more mindful about your
        emotions will allow you to identify, understand and stop your anger

        moments as a part of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        however, feelings of despair are much more challenging to work
        through. getting the motivation to work through despair takes
        energy, the same energy it works to take away from you.
      </p>
      <p>
        to start working through these feelings you mut be systematic in
        your approach and fearless in facing it head on.
      </p>
      <p>
        the good news is your first step is already complete. you've
        identified the feeling. You're self aware. But often in self
        awareness you may forget you're human. And because you're human you
        shouldn't expect perfection. From yourself or anyone else.

        We all grieve in our own way so don't worry if your grief looks

        And while grief may be painful, don't ignore or hide from it. As

        It has a way of manifesting self doubt. It decreases confidence. It

      <p>
        Don't take rejection personally. And don't assume you know why you
        are being rejected. Often our insecurities fill in knowledge gaps
        with incorrect assumptions. These assumptions, when based in our
