      <p>
        Feeling let down can stem from a variety of sources. You could feel
        disrespected. You could be frustrated with a decision someone made.
        You could feel slightly betrayed. Or a dozen other reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the objective is to capture why you are feeling let down and
        explore ways in which you can learn to accept the reality of what
        is.
