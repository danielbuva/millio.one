      <p>
        Curiousity is what we call the universal drive to find out more. We
        are constantly in some state of curiousity from mild: "what's
        that?" to deep exploration of life's mysteries. Children, in their
        first few years of life, already ask questios to satisfy their
        curiousity's hunger for complete answers to "how does this work?"
        Artists dedicate their lives to expressing some form of answer to:
        "why is it like this?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Curiousity is a drive, a hunger, a passion, a need. While it varies
        in how intensely it's felt from moment to moment and mood to mood,
        it;s never gone and it's never done.
