      <p>Pessimism is both a feeling and a philosophy.</p>
      <p>
        We often think of pessimism as something to avoid. But not so fast.
        Pessimism allows you to be realistic, understnading that unpleasant
        events will occur that are out of your control.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, pessimism can spiral out of control and create immense
        hopelessness. Remember, your thoughts create your reality. It's
        important to become idealistic in your perception.
