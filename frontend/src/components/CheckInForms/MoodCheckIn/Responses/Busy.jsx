      <p>Being busy is good. Until it isn't.</p>
      <p>
        The most important part of being busy is verifying you're being
        productive. Not just attempting to avoid the more important work
        that needs to be done.

      <p>
        Do a quick check in with yourself to make sure you are the former,
        not the latter.
