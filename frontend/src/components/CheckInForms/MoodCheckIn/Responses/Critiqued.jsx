      <p>
        Criticism comes in two flavors; criticism of self and criticism of
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Self critique, if done constructively and with kindness, helps you
        learn from your mistakes and improve.
      </p>
      <p>But negative self talk can be defeating and demoralizing.</p>
      <p>
        Always remember to be impeccable with your words to yourself and
        others.
