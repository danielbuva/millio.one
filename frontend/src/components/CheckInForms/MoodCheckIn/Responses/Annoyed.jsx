      <p>
        Annoyance tends to creep in and plant seeds of frustration and
        anger. You may be annoyed at your other people, an event or even
        yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have control over it you can work to take action to change
        what is annoying you, If you don't, work on letting it go.
