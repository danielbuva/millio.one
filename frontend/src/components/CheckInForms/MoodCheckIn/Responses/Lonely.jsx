      <p>
        Feeling lonely doesn't always mean you're alone. Even the most
        socially active person feels it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're feeling lonely for too long you must begin addressing the
        underlying issues keeping you in this state. Is it anxiety? Worry
        about being judged? Not trusting others?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes feeling lonely is really just feeling like no one
        understands you. It can lead to feelings of hurt, sadness or anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        loneliness also gives us a moment to reflect on how the most
        important relationship you have is with yourself.
