      <p>
        You're usually shocked by an unexpected outcome. Even if it's an
        outcome based on your own actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're shocked, the only thing you can control is your
        reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reign in your shock; control it. Don't make irrational decisions
        that make matters worse. Strive to be calm headed and rational in
        your response.
