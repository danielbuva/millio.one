      <p>
        Worry often presents itself as a horrible game of "What if...?" It
        takes you out of living in the moment and fixates you on all
        possible worst case scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when the worst case scenario doesn't occur, your worry is
        reinforced. As if the mere fact of worrying is what kept the
        negative even from happening.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cyclical nature of escalating worry will become maladaptive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work on accepting the realities of life and learn to cope with
        situations.
