        You may think awkwardness is a negative emotion. And it can be.
        Such as when you feel embarrassed in public.
      </p>
      <p>
        But feeling awkward can also elevate you to positive states. Lile
        when you're about to be intimate for the first time. Or about to
        have a crucial conversation. Or pushing out of your comfort zone
        and unfazed by the judgement of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Identify the origin of your awkwardness to effectively work through
        it.
